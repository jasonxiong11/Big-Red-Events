This app will allow Cornell students to see what events are happening on the campus, no matter what major or concentration they are in, and will allow students to add events to let others know. In the app, there is a tab bar that will allow the user to navigate between a discover page, a saved page, and an add events page. Every event added in the add events page will be added to the table view in the discover page.
